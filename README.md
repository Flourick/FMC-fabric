# FMC

Vanilla enhancements fabric mod

## Installation

1. Download fabric loader from [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/) (does not require Fabric-API, loader is enough)

2. Download latest FMC-fabric release from [here](https://github.com/Flourick/FMC-fabric/releases).

3. Once you run fabric loader a mods folder will be created in your *.minecraft* directory. Move the `fmc-fabric-X.X.X.jar` there.

## Features

There are currently four main features. Everything is configurable in ingame options menu called 'FMC...'

#### Crosshair

This mod disables crosshair changing it's color based on background and instead let's you choose the static color yourself. You can also set the scale of the crosshair.

If you use a crosshair from a resource pack that is already colored or you wish to have a crosshair that has multiple colors, set the color to white which will make it so only colors from the resource pack are used.

NOTE: Crosshair in resource pack is the upper-right 15x15 pixels in *assets/minecraft/textures/gui/icons.png*

#### HUD Info

Shows your location, pitch, cardinal direction and block light while ingame.

#### Disable 'W' To Sprint

The header says it all. Gets rid of one of the most annoying features.

#### Death Coordinates

Sends your last death coordinates in chat after you respawn (only visible to you).
